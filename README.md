# Statistical Analysis of Office Supplies Store Sales
Hypothesis Testing • Manual Statistical Calculations • Exploratory Data Analysis

## Description
This project involves analyzing the sales data of an office supplies store.
The main focus is on performing manual hypothesis testing to understand patterns in profit and sales across different product categories and time periods, without relying on pre-built statistical tests from libraries like scipy.stats.

The goal is to demonstrate:
Statistical reasoning
Manual calculation of test statistics
Interpretation of results
Ability to handle real-world sales data

## Objectives

- Load and clean the sales dataset
- Formulate and test two hypotheses manually
- Draw conclusions based on the computed test statistics

## Hypotheses Tested
Hypothesis 1:
There is a significant difference in average profit between two categories of products.

Hypothesis 2:
The mean profit for high-volume orders is higher than low-volume orders.

Methodology:
Null and alternative hypotheses defined for each test
Test statistics calculated manually (mean, variance, t-value)
Conclusions drawn based on comparisons

## Dataset
Source of the dataset is QUERA.

## Tools & Skills Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Manual statistical formulas (no automated hypothesis functions)

## Key Techniques
Manual t-tests / p-value
ANOVA

## Result
This project demonstrates hands-on statistical analysis, manual hypothesis testing, and the ability to extract actionable insights from sales data without relying solely on pre-built library functions.
